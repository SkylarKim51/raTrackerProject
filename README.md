# raTrackerProject
This is a project that has always been in the back of my mind and I have finally started following my layoff from DocuSign in October of 2022.
I try to contribute a couple of hours to it each week. It is a good break from the monotony of applications and daily leetcode questions. However, it
is still extremely barebones and will take much longer to finish. 

Tech Stack: This is a MERN Stack meaning the Front end is React, Backend is Node.js using Express Framework and the DataBase is MongoDB
Why MERN stack project: I was first interested in making my own website/application in a data analytics class my senior year of college. I really enjoyed working with data, manipulating it and visualizing
the results. 

What is the MVP:
  1. Login: users can login or sign up 
  2. Entries: users can enter data to the application about their current condition and it will be stored
  3. Data analysis: users can have their entries analyzed 


Improvements upon each:
  1. Login: users can login or sign up 
      a. Adding in JWT
  2. Entries: users can enter data to the application about their current condition and it will be stored
      a. users can edit and delete past entries
      b. users can only make one entry per day
  3. Data analysis: users can have their entries analyzed
